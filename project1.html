        <h1>Understanding Artificial Intelligence</h1>

        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed
            to think and learn like humans. These intelligent systems can perform tasks that typically require human
            intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.</p>

  

        <h2>Real-Life AI Examples</h2>

    
            <h3>Virtual Assistants</h3>
            <p>Virtual assistants like <span class="highlight">Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant</span> use AI to
                understand natural language, process voice commands, and provide helpful responses. These systems
                combine speech recognition, natural language processing, and machine learning to interpret user
                requests, learn from interactions, and perform tasks like setting reminders, answering questions, or
                controlling smart home devices.</p>
       

        
            <h3>Recommendation Systems</h3>
            <p>Services like Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon use AI-powered recommendation
                engines to analyze your behavior, preferences, and viewing/listening history. These systems use
                collaborative filtering and machine learning algorithms to predict what content or products you might
                enjoy, creating personalized suggestions that improve the more you use the service.</p>
